Google Endpoints API Management
===============================

Google Endpoints API Management manages the 'control plane' of an API by providing support for authentication, billing, monitoring and quota control.

It achieves this by

- allowing HTTP servers to control access to their APIs using the Google Service Management and Google Service Control APIs
- providing built-in, standards-compliant support for third-party authentication
- doing this with minimal performance impact via the use of advanced caching and aggregation algorithms
- making this easy to integrate via a servlet filters

The main documents for consuming Endpoints can be found at
https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/frameworks/java

## Installing to local maven

To install test versions to Maven for easier dependency management, simply run:

    gradle install
    
## Build pacakage
